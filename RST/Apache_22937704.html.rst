eZ Publish Platform 5.x : Apache
================================

Created by yannick.roger@ez.no, last modified by andre.romcke@ez.no on

You can run apache using `Virtual
host <Virtual-host-setup_7438507.html>`__ or
`htaccess <htaccess-example_7438571.html>`__, supported versions of
Apache isÂ 2.2.x and 2.4.x

Icon

Apache must run in "prefork" mode instead of "threaded" mode - the
reason for this is because some of the libraries that PHP extensions use
might not be thread-safe.
