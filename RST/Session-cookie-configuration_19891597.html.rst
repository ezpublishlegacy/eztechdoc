eZ Publish Platform 5.x : Session cookie configuration
======================================================

*See `overview of Sessions <Session_8323282.html>`__ in eZ Publish
before you read this.*

Symfony offers the possibility to change many session options at
application level (i.e. in
Symfony \ ```framework ``\ configuration <http://symfony.com/doc/master/reference/configuration/framework.html>`__),
such as:

-  ``cookie_domain``
-  ``cookie_path``
-  ``cookie_lifetime``
-  ``cookie_secure``
-  ``cookie_httponly``

However as eZ Publish can be used for setting up several web sites
within on Symfony application, session configuration is also possible to
define per SiteAccess and SiteGroup level.

Session options per SiteAccess
------------------------------

As of eZ Publish 5.3 / 2014.03, all site related session configuration
is possible to define per SiteAccess and SiteGroup:

**ezpublish.yml**

.. code:: theme:

    ezpublish:
        system:
            my_siteaccess:
                session:
                    # By default Session name is eZSESSID{siteaccess_hash}
                    # with setting below you'll get eZSESSID{name},
                    # allowing you to share sessions across SiteAccess
                    name: my_session_name
                    # These are optional. 
                    # If not defined they will fallback to Symfony framework configuration, 
                    # which itself fallback to default php.ini settings
                    cookie_domain: mydomain.com
                    cookie_path: /foo
                    cookie_lifetime: 86400
                    cookie_secure: false
                    cookie_httponly: true

Session name per SiteAccess
---------------------------

In 5.x versions prior to 5.3 / 2014.03 the following SiteAccess aware
session setting where available:

**ezpublish.yml**

.. code:: theme:

    ezpublish:
        system:
            my_siteaccess:
                # By default Session name is eZSESSID{siteaccess_hash}
                # with setting below you'll get eZSESSID{name},
                # allowing you to share sessions across SiteAccess
                # This setting is deprecated as of 5.3
                session_name: my_session_name
