eZ Publish Platform 5.x : Developing with eZ Publish 5
======================================================

Created by andre.romcke@ez.no, last modified by

This covers common, everyday tasks - basic to intermediate level.For
more advanced development techniques, and extending the provided
functionality, see `Extending eZ Publish
5 <Extending-eZ-Publish-5_1736733.html>`__

There are two official approaches to building applications on top of eZ
Publish 5:

-  by connecting to the `eZ Publish REST
   API <eZ-Publish-REST-API_6292277.html>`__
-  by using the `eZ Publish Public
   API <eZ-Publish-Public-API_1736723.html>`__ and `MVC/Application <MVC-and-Application_2719826.html>`__ layer
   (Symfony2 based).

In the latter case Public SPI provides the "model" (the data from the
database and the file system) and the MVC/Application layer provides all
the application logic (configuration, routing, controlling, etc...).

The SPI is used to implement a new storage engine for your eZ Publish
application.

API and SPI repositories

Icon

| The API and SPI are available in separate repositories to improve the
dependencies management. Both repositories API and SPI are a read-only
split of ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel.
| See `the details about how make the dependence with the API or the
SPI <SPI-and-API-repositories_1736729.html>`__ in your project.
