eZ Publish Platform 5.x : Copie de Logging configuration
========================================================

Created by sarah.haim-lubczanski@ez.no on Nov 13, 2014

-  `Introduction <#CopiedeLoggingconfiguration-Introduction>`__
-  `Usage example <#CopiedeLoggingconfiguration-Usageexample>`__

Introduction
============

The current implementation includes a logging mechanism for debugging
purposes in development environments, which monitors
`Stash <http://stash.tedivm.com/>`__, introduced in
`Stash-bundle <https://github.com/tedivm/TedivmStashBundle>`__, and the
`persistence cache <Persistence-cache-configuration_12781293.html>`__
mechanism.

Logging is enabled by default, except for the production environment to
avoid excessive memory usage on production environments.

Â 

Usage example
=============

| StashBundle logging, represented by the ``stash.logging`` setting, and
persistence cache logging, represented by the setting
``parameters.ezpublish.spi.persistence.cache.persistenceLogger.enableCallLogging``,
and are both enabled by default on development environments.
| Both settings expect a boolean value (``true`` or ``false``), so, if
you desire to turn off the logging mechanism you can use the following
configuration in ``ezpublish_dev.yml``:

**ezpublish\_dev.yml**

.. code:: theme:

    stash:
        logging: false
        caches:
            default:
                handlers:
                    - FileSystem
                inMemory: false
                registerDoctrineAdapter: false

    parameters:
        ezpublish.spi.persistence.cache.persistenceLogger.enableCallLogging: false

Icon

Be aware that using stash logging and persistence cache logging will
require additional memory. This should be used for debugging purposes
only.
