======================================

Created by andrea.melo@ez.no, last modified by andre.romcke@ez.no on Sep

This chapter explains how to obtain and install eZ Publish. In addition,
it also describes how to remove an existing eZ Publish installation.

If you don't want to install eZ Publish yourself,  there are a lot
of \ `various providers and
partners <http://ez.no/Partners/Success-with-eZ>`__ that can help you
with this, and for more advance needs there is also \ `eZ Professional
Services <http://ez.no/Services/Professional-Services>`__.

There are 3 ways of installing eZ Publish, first picking one of:

#. `Normal
   installation <Normal-installation_7438509.html>`__ (recommended
   |(thumbs up)|)
#. `Manual installation <Manual-installation_7438512.html>`__
#. `Automated installation <Automated-installation_7438514.html>`__

Afterwards it is highly recommended to update your system, if your on
5.3 or higher this is documented in maintenance release notes in \ `eZ
Publish 5.x Releases <eZ-Publish-5.x-Releases_12781017.html>`__, for
older enterprise releases consult with your service-portal/support
documentation.

Normal installation
===================

| This is\ **the recommended and most commonly used way** of installing
eZ Publish.
| It requires a system which already has the proper environment
installed, most notably a web server and a database.

eZ Publish needs to be downloaded and unpacked. A web-based `Setup
Wizard <The-setup-wizard_7438516.html>`__ is initiated using a browser.
The Setup Wizard asks a couple of questions and automatically configures
eZ Publish.

The method is explained under the \ `Normal
installation <Normal-installation_7438509.html>`__ section.

Manual installation
===================

| This option is **for experienced users**. No wizards or fancy dialogs,
no bundled software, no installers, no nothing.
| This method requires a system which already has a web-server and a
database set up and ready to go.

eZ Publish needs to be downloaded and unpacked. The system is then
configured by manually altering various configuration files and making
manual changes to the database.

This method is explained under the `Manual
installation <Manual-installation_7438512.html>`__ section.

Automated installation
======================

| This installation method (also named kick-start) is designed **for
system administrators** who wish to roll out pre-configured
installations of eZ Publish that require a minimum of interaction with
the web-based setup wizard.
| It requires a system which already has the proper environment
installed, most notably a web server and a database.

eZ Publish needs to be downloaded and unpacked. Instead of clicking
through the setup wizard and manually providing configuration
parameters, the system is installed based on a group of settings defined
in a configuration file.

The \ `Automated installation <Automated-installation_7438514.html>`__
section explains how to prepare such a configuration file.
