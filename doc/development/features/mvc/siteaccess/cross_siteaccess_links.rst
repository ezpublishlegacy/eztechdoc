This page is compatible with \ **eZ Publish 5.3 / 2014.03**

 

| When using the *multisite* feature, it is sometimes useful to be able
to **generate cross-links** between the different sites.
|  This allows to link different resources referenced in a same content
repository, but configured independently with different tree roots.

Usage
-----

**Twig example**

.. code:: theme:

     {# Linking a location #} 
    <a href="{{ url( location, {"siteaccess": "some_siteaccess_name"} ) }}">{{ ez_content_name( content ) }}</a>

    {# Linking a regular route #} 
    <a href="{{ url( "some_route_name", {"siteaccess": "some_siteaccess_name"} ) }}">Hello world!</a>

**PHP example**

.. code:: theme:

    namespace Acme\TestBundle\Controller;

    use eZ\Bundle\EzPublishCoreBundle\Controller as BaseController;
    use Symfony\Component\Routing\Generator\UrlGeneratorInterface;

    class MyController extends BaseController
    {
        public function fooAction()
        {
            // ...

            $location = $this->getRepository()->getLocationService()->loadLocation( 123 );
            $locationUrl = $this->generateUrl(
                $location,
                array( 'siteaccess' => 'some_siteaccess_name' ),
                UrlGeneratorInterface::ABSOLUTE_PATH
            );

            $regularRouteUrl = $this->generateUrl(
                'some_route_name',
                array( 'siteaccess' => 'some_siteaccess_name' ),
                UrlGeneratorInterface::ABSOLUTE_PATH
            );

            // ...
        }
    }

| **Important**: As SiteAccess matchers can involve hosts and ports, it
is **highly recommended** to generate cross-siteaccess
|  links in the absolute form (e.g. using ``url()`` Twig helper).

Troubleshooting
---------------

-  The\ **first matcher succeeding always wins**, so be careful when
   using *catch-all* matchers like ``URIElement``.
-  If passed SiteAccess name is not a valid one, an
   ``InvalidArgumentException`` will be thrown.
-  If matcher used to match provided SiteAccess doesn't implement
   ``VersatileMatcher``, the link will be generated for the current
   SiteAccess.
-  When using ``Compound\LogicalAnd``, all inner matchers **must
   match**. If at least one matcher doesn't implement
   ``VersatileMatcher``, it will fail.
-  When using ``Compound\LogicalOr``, the first inner matcher succeeding
   will win.

Under the hood
--------------

| To implement this feature, a new ``VersatileMatcher`` was added to
allow SiteAccess matchers to be able to *reverse-match*.
|  All existing matchers implement this new interface, except the Regexp
based matchers which have been deprecated.

The SiteAccess router has been added a ``matchByName()`` method to
reflect this addition. Abstract URLGenerator and ``DefaultRouter`` have
been updated as well.

**Note:** SiteAccess router public methods have also been extracted to a
new interface, ``SiteAccessRouterInterface``.

Comments:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Hi, in the PHP code example, since you meant to generate absolute URL's, |
| you need to pass the constant \ *UrlGeneratorInterface::ABSOLUTE\_URL*   |
| to *``$this``\ ``->generateUrl``* instead of                             |
| *``UrlGeneratorInterface::ABSOLUTE_PATH.``*                              |
|                                                                          |

|                                                                          |
