eZ Publish Platform 5.x : SPI and API repositories
==================================================

Created by andre.romcke@ez.no, last modified by bertrand.dunogier@ez.no
on Mar 31, 2014

Those repositories are read-only split of
``ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel``, made available to make dependencies
easier and more lightweight.

API
---

| This package is a split of the eZ Publish 5 public API. It includes
the **services interfaces** and **domain objects** from the
``eZ\Publish\API`` namespace.
| It offers a lightweight way to make your project depend on the eZ API
and Domain objects, without depending on the whole ezpublish-kernel.
| The repository is read-only, automatically updated from
`https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel>`__.

Requiring ezpublish-api in your project:

.. code:: theme:

    "require": {
        "ezsystems/ezpublish-api": "~5.0"
    }

SPI
---

This package is a split of the eZ Publish 5 SPI (persistence
interfaces).

It can be used as a dependency, instead of the whole ezpublish-kernel,
by packages implementing **custom eZ Publish storage engines**, or by
any package that requires **classes from the eZ\\Publish\\SPI
namespace**.

The repository is read-only, automatically updated from
`https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel>`__.

Requiring ezpublish-api in your project:

.. code:: theme:

    "require": {
        "ezsystems/ezpublish-spi": "~5.0"
    }

Comments:
---------

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| This doesn't work with the community edition - at the moment, you must   |
| either use a stable community version (xxxx.xx.x) or "~5.0@dev".         |
|                                                                          |
| Is there a reason why the community version doesn't use semantic         |
| versioning?                                                              |
|                                                                          |

| Good point, \ `Jérôme Gamez <https://doc.ez.no/display/~jgamez>`__. We   |
| should use ``~5.0|20XX.YY.ZZ.``.                                         |
|                                                                          |
