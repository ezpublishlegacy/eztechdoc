=============================================

The normal installation method is the most common and recommended way of
deploying eZ Publish. It requires a system which already has the proper
environment installed, most notably **a web server and a database**. The
necessary
`requirements <Requirements-for-doing-a-normal-installation_7438584.html>`__
are explained in detail within the `next
section <Requirements-for-doing-a-normal-installation_7438584.html>`__.

Once the web based Setup Wizard has completed, eZ Publish will be
**ready for use**.

The "`Installing eZ Publish on a Linux-UNIX based
system <Installing-eZ-Publish-on-a-Linux-UNIX-based-system_7438581.html>`__\ "
and "`Installing eZ Publish on
Windows <Installing-eZ-Publish-on-Windows_7438583.html>`__\ " sections
(depending on the target OS) will take you through the necessary steps.
