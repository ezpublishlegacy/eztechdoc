eZ Publish Platform 5.x : htaccess example
==========================================

Created by andrea.melo@ez.no, last modified by andre.romcke@ez.no on May

These rewrite rules can be used if you don't have direct access to alter
the virtual host configuration, which is common in a shared hosting
setup. For pure legacy or eZ Publish 4.x installation
see .htaccess\_root in the root of the project.

Please find an example of the "``.htaccess``\ " rewrite rules below:

::

    # Copy this file to a new file called .htaccess in your eZ Publish web folder
    # to secure your installation by turning on .htaccess based virtual host mode.

    # Environment.
    # Possible values: "prod" and "dev" out-of-the-box, other values possible with proper configuration
    # Defaults to "prod" if omitted
    SetEnv ENVIRONMENT "prod"

    # Whether to use Symfony's ApcClassLoader.
    # Possible values: 0 or 1
    # Defaults to 0 if omitted
    #SetEnv USE_APC_CLASSLOADER 0

    # Prefix used when USE_APC_CLASSLOADER is set to 1.
    # Use a unique prefix in order to prevent cache key conflicts
    # with other applications also using APC.
    # Defaults to "ezpublish" if omitted
    #SetEnv APC_CLASSLOADER_PREFIX "ezpublish"

    # Whether to use debugging.
    # Possible values: 0 or 1
    # Defaults to 0 if omitted, unless ENVIRONMENT is set to: "dev"
    #SetEnv USE_DEBUGGING 0

    # Whether to use Symfony's HTTP Caching.
    # Disable it if you are using an external reverse proxy (e.g. Varnish)
    # Possible values: 0 or 1
    # Defaults to 1 if omitted, unless ENVIRONMENT is set to: "dev"
    #SetEnv USE_HTTP_CACHE 1

    # Defines the proxies to trust.
    # Separate entries by a comma
    # Example: "proxy1.example.com,proxy2.example.org"
    # By default, no trusted proxies are set
    #SetEnv TRUSTED_PROXIES "127.0.0.1"
