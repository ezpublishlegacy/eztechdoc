Others
======

-  Lighttpd is known to work as well but is currently not supported.
   "Rewrite" rules for this web server can be found online, f.e. on the
   forums on `share.ez.no <http://share.ez.no>`__.
-  On Windows, it is recommended to use MS IIS 7 or higher (with
   Microsoft URL Rewrite Module 1.1 or higher). Apache 2.x for Windows
   is not supported since it only exists in "threaded" mode. See
   `Installing eZ Publish on
   Windows <Installing-eZ-Publish-on-Windows_7438583.html>`__
