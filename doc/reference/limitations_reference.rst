eZ Publish Platform 5.x : Limitations reference
===============================================

Created and last modified by andre.romcke@ez.no on Jun 30, 2014

Intro
-----

Limitations are the building blocks of the permission system in 5.x,
they provide the limitations you can apply to a given access right to
limit the right to certain conditions.

Limitations consists of two parts:

-  ``Limitation`` (Value)
-  ``LimitationType``

Certain limitations are also "RoleLimitations", meaning they can be used
to limit the rights of a Role assignment, this is currently ``Subtree``
and ``Section`` limitation.

| The ``Limitation`` represent the value, while ``LimitationType`` deals
with the business logic surrounding how it actually works and is
enforced.
| LimitationTypes have two modes of operation in regards to permission
logic (seeÂ ``eZ\Publish\SPI\Limitation\Type`` interface for more info):

+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Method             | Used when                                                                                                                                                                                       |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``evaluate``       | Evaluating if user has access to a given object in a certain context (for instance a context can be Locations when object is ``Content``), under the condition of the ``Limitation`` value(s)   |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``getCriterion``   | Generates a ``Criterion`` using ``Limitation`` value and current user which ``SearchService`` by default applies to search criteria for filtering search based on permissions                   |
