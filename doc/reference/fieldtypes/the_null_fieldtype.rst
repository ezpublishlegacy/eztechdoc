eZ Publish Platform 5.x : The Null FieldType
============================================

Created and last modified by petar.spanja@ez.no on May 23, 2014

This field type is used for fallback and testing purposes.

Name

Internal name

Expected input type

``Null``

``variable``

``mixed``

Description
-----------

As integration with Legacy Stack requires that all FieldTypes are also
also handled on 5.x stack side, Null FieldType is provided as a dummy
for legacy FieldTypes that are not really implemented on 5.x side.

Icon

Null FieldType will accept anything provided as a value, but will not
store anything to the database, nor will it read any data from the
database.

This FieldType does not have its own fixed internal name. Its identifier
is instead configured as is needed by passing it as an argument to the
constructor.

Following example shows how Null FieldType is used to configure dummy
implementations for ``ezcomcomments`` and ``ezpaex`` legacy datatypes:

**Null Fieldtype example configuration**

.. code:: theme:

    parameters:
        ezpublish.fieldType.eznull.class: eZ\Publish\Core\FieldType\Null\Type

    services:
        ezpublish.fieldType.ezcomcomments:
            class: %ezpublish.fieldType.eznull.class%
            parent: ezpublish.fieldType
            arguments: [ "ezcomcomments" ]
            tags:
                - {name: ezpublish.fieldType, alias: ezcomcomments}
        ezpublish.fieldType.ezpaex:
            class: %ezpublish.fieldType.eznull.class%
            parent: ezpublish.fieldType
            arguments: [ "ezpaex" ]
            tags:
                - {name: ezpublish.fieldType, alias: ezpaex}
