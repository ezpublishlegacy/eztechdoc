|                                      | eZ developers have traditionally     |
|                                      | been used to.                        |

+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

5.3 Features
------------

5.3 introduces several new features which makes it easier to use, faster
to develop on and also continues to improve performance.

Doctrine DBAL / DoctrineBundle use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

eZ Publish 5.3 now uses Doctrine DBAL instead of Zeta Components
Database. This allows users to reuse database connection and settings
with other pure Symfony2 bundles which uses Doctrine ORM (default choice
in Symfony2 documentation and code generators).

-  Documentation:

   -  `Content Repository
      configuration <Content-Repository-configuration_19891591.html>`__
   -  `Upgrade
      documentation <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/blob/master/doc/upgrade/5.3.md#database-configuration>`__

-  Implementation details: `Original JIRA
   issue <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22279>`__, `DoctrineBundle
   integration
   pull-request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/736>`__,
   `Legacy storage engine refactoring
   pull-request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/704>`__,
   `Legacy storage engine refactoring
   pull-request <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22151>`__

User authentication using Symfony security component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New login / logout functionality that uses Symfony's authentication
system. This enables any kind of login handler or SSO handler made for
Symfony to also work with eZ Publish 5., including handlers for LDAP.

-  Documentation:

   -  `Authentication with
      Symfony <https://confluence.ez.no/display/EZP/Authentication>`__
   -  `How to authenticate a user with multiple user
      providers <How-to-authenticate-a-user-with-multiple-user-providers_19891606.html>`__

-  Implementation details: `Original
   issue <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22045>`__, `Original pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/656>`__, \ `Multiple
   user providers issue <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22081>`__,
   `Multiple user providers pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/683>`__

Full Composer support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With 5.3 there is no longer two ways to deal with updates. Now it is
only composer updates also for eZ Publish related software.

-  Documentation: `Using Composer <Using-Composer_23527865.html>`__,
   `5.3.1 Release Notes <5.3.1-Release-Notes_23527464.html>`__, \ `5.3.2
   Release Notes <5.3.2-Release-Notes_23528040.html>`__

Legacy SSO support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allows use of existing legacy SSO handlers with the new user login
system in 5.3 which is powered by Symfony.

-  Documentation: `Authentication with Legacy SSO
   Handlers <Authentication_19891028.html#Authentication-AuthenticationwithLegacySSOHandlers>`__
-  Implementation details: `Original
   issue <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22099>`__, `Original pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/691>`__\ ` <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22099>`__

Content Preview using "eZ Platform" stack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With 5.3 your content previewing needs, also from the current legacy
based admin interface will run on the new "*eZ Platform*\ " stack,
avoiding that you need to also create all templates in legacy to be able
to preview correctly.

-  Implementation details:
   `Original <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22051>`__\ `Issue <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22051>`__,
   `Original pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/662>`__

Solr 4.x support in eZ Find and API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Preview of Solr 4.x support in API and bundled Solr 4.7.0 support for
ezfind allows for use of new functionality provided by Solr 4.x such as
improved performance for indexing and new options like soft commit to
control this.

eZ Find:

-  Documentation: `What is new in eZ Find LS
   5.3.0? <https://doc.ez.no/Extensions/eZ-Publish-extensions/eZ-Find/eZ-Find-LS-5.3.0/What-is-new-in-eZ-Find-LS-5.3.0>`__
-  Implementation details: `Original pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/649>`__

Ubuntu 14.04 support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As announced in a recent blog post `"5.3 to come with broader platform
support and improved
performance" <http://share.ez.no/blogs/core-development-team/5.3-to-come-with-broader-platform-support-and-improved-performance>`__,
we have added support for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, including full support for
MySQL 5.6, MariaDB 5.5, Nginx 1.4, Apache 2.4 and PHP 5.5

-  Documentation: `Requirements 5.3 <Requirements-5.3_21299647.html>`__

Twig & Tpl Template debug in Symfony Web debug Toolbar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Developer feature known from legacy which allows you to see which
templates are used on a page, how many times and how much time they
spend being executed.

-  Documentation: `Templates informations in Web Debug
   Toolbar <https://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/User-manual/5.x/The-Website-Interface/Customization-Guide/Templates-informations-in-Web-Debug-Toolbar>`__
-  Implementation details: `Original
   issue <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22152>`__, `Original pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/695>`__

Admin Interface: Comment moderation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following the Comments integration `added in
5.2 <5.2-Changelog_19234955.html>`__ we have in this release exposed
this also in backend as a tab per content, allowing you to easily get
access to Disqus moderation per content within backend of eZ Publish.

-  Documentation: `Comments
   Tab <https://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/User-manual/5.x/The-Administration-Interface/The-Content-structure-tab#eztoc131421_0_2_8>`__

Language Switcher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The language switcher is built on the Symfony stack and is improved for
a simpler usage.

-  Documentation: `Language
   Switcher <Language-Switcher_21299899.html>`__
-  Implementation details: `Original
   issue <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22464>`__, `Original pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/834>`__

Location Search API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tree based "fetches" are now allowed be performed with the new Location
Search API, allowing generation of tree structures much more easily by
returning the location instead of content, as done by existing Content
Search API, and by applying any location filters on the specific
location instead of *any* of the locations of a Content object.

-  Documentation: `Working with
   Locations <4.-Working-with-Locations_6292984.html>`__
-  Implementation details: `Original
   issue <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22105>`__ ,\ `Original pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/701>`__

REST API v2 improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HTTP Cache aware, CORS support and support for OPTIONS method.

-  Documentation: `REST API
   v2 <https://confluence.ez.no/display/EZP52/eZ+Publish+REST+API>`__
-  Implementation details: `Issue for HTTP Cache
   aware <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-21044>`__, `Issue for CORS
   support <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-21118>`__, `Issue for REST
   OPTIONS <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-21044>`__, `Pull request for
   HTTP Cache
   aware <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/659>`__,

   support <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/663>`__,
   `Pull request for
   OPTIONS <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/653>`__

Search API support for MapLocation Criterion and SortClause
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Search API is now able to search for content with geolocation making it
possible to do geolocation range searches and sorting by distance from a
point; on Demo site this is shown using a restaurants-close-to-you page.

-  Documentation: `2. Browsing, finding,
   viewing#2.Browsing,finding,viewing-Search <6292980.html#id-2.Browsing,finding,viewing-2.Browsing,finding,viewing-Search>`__

-  Implementation details: `Original
   issue <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22103>`__, `Original pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/678>`__

Legacy extensions in bundles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With this new feature mixing legacy and "eZ Platform" needs has become a
whole lot easier. Easily said it allows you to place legacy extensions
within a Bundle structure and eZ Publish 5.3+ will make sure it is
injected into legacy kernel.

Example use case: CommentsBundle with a light admin tab in legacy
allowing you to moderate comments.

-  Documentation: `Legacy code and features -
   Legacybundles <Legacy-code-and-features_8323433.html#Legacycodeandfeatures-Legacybundles>`__
-  Implementation details: `Original
   issue <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22210>`__, `Original pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/719>`__

Legacy Website Toolbar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not to be mixed with the Web Debug Toolbar provided by Symfony and
extended by eZ Publish, this feature is about allowing "ezwt" (Website
Toolbar) extension to also work in DemoBundle to provide the front-end
editing functionality that you know from 4.x.

-  Documentation: `Display the eZ Website
   Toolbar <Display-the-eZ-Website-Toolbar_21299478.html>`__
-  Implementation details: `Original JIRA
   Issue <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22193>`__, `Original pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/755>`__

Demo Site: Places
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Taking advantage of the MapLocation feature a new feature is exposed in
the demo showing how to implement listing and map views of content using
the maplocation field.

-  Documentation: `The MapLocation
   FieldType <The-MapLocation-FieldType_19235056.html>`__
-  Implementation details: `Original
   issue <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22091>`__, `Original pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/678>`__

   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/664>`__,
   `documentation <https://confluence.ez.no/display/EZP/Setting+the+Index+Page>`__)
-  `ez\_is\_field\_empty <ez_is_field_empty_17105612.html>`__, updated
   to support passing field object as second parameter.
