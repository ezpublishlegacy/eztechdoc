|                                      | | eZ Publish Platform 5.3 is a LTS   |
|                                      | (Long term supported) release (see   |

|                                      | offers a continuous improvement of   |
|                                      | the "Platform stack" (previously     |
|                                      | referred to as "New Stack", "Symfony |
|                                      | stack" or "6.x stack") introduced    |
|                                      | with eZ Publish Platform 5 in terms  |
|                                      | of features, usability and           |
|                                      | performance.                         |
|                                      | | The main topic of 5.3 has been to  |
|                                      | improve a lot in terms of            |
|                                      | integration with Symfony             |
|                                      | environment, building websites on    |
|                                      | the "*eZ Platform*\ " stack and      |
|                                      | continuously removing legacy         |
|                                      | dependencies. From 5.3, while it is  |
|                                      | still possible to use the legacy     |
|                                      | stack and templating system, we      |
|                                      | think using the new platform and the |
|                                      | Symfony framework is the main way to |
|                                      | go. This new platform will also be   |
|                                      | the foundation for the future eZ     |
|                                      | Platform as introduced recently      |
|                                      | (previously referred as "6.x") where |
|                                      | it will operate standalone, without  |
|                                      | dependencies on the legacy stack.    |
|                                      |                                      |
|                                      | It serves the needs for both a       |
|                                      | future proofed websites on top of    |
|                                      | the upcoming "*eZ Platform*\ "       |
|                                      | stack, and as a stable foundation    |
|                                      | for upgrade needs for existing       |
|                                      | legacy (4.x) sites with support for  |
|                                      | the next 3+2 years.                  |

|                                      | It will also be easily upgradable to |

|                                      | supported for the length of the 5.3  |
|                                      | support period and provide           |

+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

5.3 Features
------------

5.3 introduces several new features which makes it easier to use, faster
to develop on and also continues to improve performance.

Doctrine DBAL / DoctrineBundle use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

eZ Publish 5.3 now uses Doctrine DBAL instead of Zeta Components
Database, this allows users to reuse database connection and settings
with other pure Symfony2 bundles which uses Doctrine ORM (default choice
in Symfony2 documentation and code generators).

-  `DoctrineBundle integration
   pull-request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/736>`__
-  `Legacy storage engine refactoring
   pull-request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/704>`__

-  `Upgrade
   documentation <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/blob/master/doc/upgrade/5.3.md#database-configuration>`__

User authentication using Symfony security component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New login / logout functionality that uses Symfony's authentication
system, this enables any kind of login handler or SSO handler made for
Symfony to also work with eZ Publish 5., including handlers for LDAP.

-  `Original pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/691>`__
-  `Original issue <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22081>`__

-  `Documentation: How to authenticate a user with multiple user
   providers <How-to-authenticate-a-user-with-multiple-user-providers_19891606.html>`__

Legacy SSO support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allows use of existing legacy SSO handlers with the new user login
system in 5.3 which is powered by Symfony.

-  `Original pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/691>`__
-  `Original issue <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22099>`__
-  `Documentation: Authentication with Legacy SSO
   Handlers <Authentication_19891028.html#Authentication-AuthenticationwithLegacySSOHandlers>`__

Content Preview using "eZ Platform"* *\ stack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With 5.3 your content previewing needs, also from the current legacy
based admin interface will run on the new "*eZ Platform*\ " stack,
avoiding that you need to also create all templates in legacy to be able
to preview correctly.

-  `Original pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/662>`__
-  `Original <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22051>`__\ `Issue <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22051>`__

Twig & Tpl Template debug in Symfony Web debug Toolbar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Developer feature known from legacy which allows you to see which
templates are used on a page, how many times and how much time they
spend being executed.

-  `Original pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/695>`__
-  `Original issue <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22152>`__
-  `Documentation : Templates informations in Web Debug
   Toolbar <https://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/User-manual/5.x/The-Website-Interface/Customization-Guide/Templates-informations-in-Web-Debug-Toolbar>`__

Language Switcher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The language switcher is built on the Symfony stack and is improved for
a simpler usage.

-  `Original pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/834>`__
-  `Original issue <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22464>`__
-  `Documentation : Language
   Switcher <Language-Switcher_21299899.html>`__

Location Search API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tree based "fetches" are now allowed be performed with the new Location
Search API, allowing generation of tree structures much more easily by
returning the location instead of content, as done by existing Content
Search API, and by applying any location filters on the specific
location instead of *any* of the locations of a Content object.

-  `Original pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/701>`__
-  `Original issue <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22105>`__

REST API v2 improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HTTP Cache aware, CORS support and support for OPTIONS method.

   aware <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/659>`__,
   `Pull request for CORS
   support <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/663>`__,

-  `Documentation : REST API
   v2 <https://confluence.ez.no/display/EZP52/eZ+Publish+REST+API>`__

Search API support for MapLocation Criterion and SortClause
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Search API is now able to search for content with geolocation making it
possible to do geolocation range searches and sorting by distance from a
point; on Demo site this is shown using a restaurants-close-to-you page.

-  `Original pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/678>`__
-  `Original issue <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22103>`__
-  Documentation : `2. Browsing, finding,
   viewing#2.Browsing,finding,viewing-Search <6292980.html#id-2.Browsing,finding,viewing-2.Browsing,finding,viewing-Search>`__

Legacy extensions in bundles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With this new feature mixing legacy and "eZ Platform" needs has become a
whole lot easier. Easily said it allows you to place legacy extensions
within a Bundle structure and eZ Publish 5.3+ will make sure it is
injected into legacy kernel.

Example use case: CommentsBundle with a light admin tab in legacy
allowing you to moderate comments.

-  `Original pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/719>`__
-  `Original issue <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22210>`__
-  `Documentation : Legacy code and features -
   Legacybundles <Legacy-code-and-features_8323433.html#Legacycodeandfeatures-Legacybundles>`__

Legacy Website Toolbar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not to be mixed with the Web Debug Toolbar provided by Symfony and
extended by eZ Publish, this feature is about allowing "ezwt" (Website
Toolbar) extension to also work in DemoBundle to provide the front-end
editing functionality that you know from 4.x.

-  `Original pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/755>`__
-  `Original JIRA Issue <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22193>`__
-  `Display the eZ Website
   Toolbar <Display-the-eZ-Website-Toolbar_21299478.html>`__

eZFind Solr 4.x support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solr 4.7.0 support in ezfind allows for use of new functionality
provided by Solr 4.x such as Solr Cloud allowing Solr to be scaled out
over several servers, it also provides improved performance for indexing
and new options like soft commit to control this.

-  `Original pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/649>`__
-  *Note: This feature currently has several regressions, feedback
   wanted on how it behaves at your side.*

Demo Site: Places
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Taking advantage of the MapLocation feature a new feature is exposed in
the demo showing how to implement listing and map views of content using
the maplocation field.

-  `Original pull
   request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/678>`__
-  `Original issue <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22091>`__
-  `Documentation on The MapLocation
   FieldType <The-MapLocation-FieldType_19235056.html>`__
