+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| eZ Publish Platform 5.4 is our last 5.x release before we launch eZ      |
| Platform (aka 6.0) next year, based on the Platform parts that have been |
| introduced and matured during the 5.x releases starting with 5.0 two     |
| years ago.                                                               |

| 5.4 is a sibling release to 5.3, meaning it will be supported as a LTS   |
| (`Long term supported <http://support.ez.no/Public/Service-Life>`__)     |
| together with it. Where 5.3 provides already very high stability, 5.4    |
| provides further forward compatibility with  `eZ                         |
| Platform <http://ez.no/About-eZ/Blog/Introducing-eZ-Platform-And-Its-New |
| -Development-Cycle>`__,                                                  |
| and in addition to shipping with new "eZ Platform" features as showcased |
| below, 5.4 will thus receive some additional improvements during first   |
| part of 2015 when necessary to make sure upgrading from 5.4 to eZ        |
| Platform will be as smooth as possible.                                  |

| *Rolling update:* This beta is a rolling update, there are beta / RC     |

5.4 Features
------------

5.3 introduces several new features which makes it easier to use, faster
to develop on and also continues to improve performance.

Batteries included: Symfony 2.5, later update to 2.6  & 2.7 LTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given the theme of this release compared to 5.3 is to provider access to
all the latests features and be as close to what you would expect from
eZ Platform next year, we bundle it with Symfony 2.5 which provide a
slew of new features and improvements to make your life easier. We
further plan to bump the Symfony version to Symfony 2.6 in December, and
lastly update to 2.7LTS in beginning of summer 2015. Symfony 2.7LTS is
the Symfony version 5.4 will be supported with for the rest of it's long
term supported life.

New features since Symfony 2.3LTS:

-  `Symfony 2.4 <http://symfony.com/blog/symfony-2-4-0-released>`__
-  `Symfony
   2.5 <http://symfony.com/blog/symfony-2-5-0-beta-1-released>`__
-  December 2014 update: `Symfony
   2.6 <http://symfony.com/blog/symfony-2-6-0-beta1-released>`__
-  Summer 2015 update: Symfony 2.7 LTS

Binary files / IO improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Native IO support, using Flysystem as a default handler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Handling of binary files input/output is now native. The default
configuration
uses \ `thephpleague/flysystem <https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem>`__,
an abstract Flysystem library. This will allow eZ Platform to support
all kind of solutions for binary storage in the future.

-  Pull-request: \ `ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel#1017 <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/1017>`__
-  JIRA issue: 
   `|image2|\ EZP-23328 <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-23328>`__ - Split
   the IO handler interface Closed
-  Documentation: \ `https://doc.ez.no/display/EZP6/Binary+files+handling <https://doc.ez.no/display/EZP6/Binary+files+handling>`__

Native support for legacy DFS cluster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Building on top of the Native IO system, a legacy metadata handler has
been added, compatible with the legacy database, the official solution
for multi-server eZ Publish 4.x and 5.x. This avoids the overhead of
legacy fallbacks for binary file lookups in 5.4.

-  Pull-request: \ `ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel#1031 <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/1031>`__
-  JIRA issue: 
   `|image3|\ EZP-23437 <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-23437>`__ -
   Finish the native DFS IO metadata handler Closed
-  Documentation: \ `https://doc.ez.no/display/EZP6/Legacy+DFS+cluster <https://doc.ez.no/display/EZP6/Legacy+DFS+cluster>`__

URL decorators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The revamp of the IO architecture brings much flexibility in how URL of
images and binary files are handled. It is now very easy to serve images
from a static server by means of semantic configuration.

-  Pull-request: \ `ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel#1039 <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/1039>`__
-  JIRA issue: 
   `|image4|\ EZP-23441 <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-23441>`__ - IO
   Url decorator configuration Closed
-  Documentation: \ `https://doc.ez.no/display/EZP6/Binary+files+URL+handling <https://doc.ez.no/display/EZP6/Binary+files+URL+handling>`__

New ImageAlias system using Imagine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Image alias system can be considered as one of the oldest features in eZ
Publish. It is a very flexible mechanism for managing content images and
has long proven its efficiency. For 5.4 we have migrated the feature to
nbeing Symfony based using LiipImagineBundle and Imagine library. This
allows for new functionality in terms of extensibility for develipng
your own filters and built in support for image handling
via \ **GD** (default), **ImageMagick** (through `Imagick PHP
extension <http://php.net/imagick>`__)
and \ **GraphicsMagick** (through `Gmagick PHP
extension <http://php.net/gmagick>`__).

-  Blog post: \ `New in eZ 5.4: Image alias system
   revamped <http://share.ez.no/blogs/core-development-team/new-in-ez-5.4-image-alias-system-revamped>`__

Improved HTTPCache system using FOSHTTPCache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Being built on top of Symfony, a HTTP framework, Varnish support in eZ
Publish is implicit. In 5.2 we introduced \ `context-aware Http
cache <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/blob/master/doc/specifications/cache/context_aware_http_cache.md>`__,
allowing cache to be shared even for authenticated users. Version 5.4
goes one step further, adding native support for Varnish 4, and more.

-  Blog post: \ `New in eZ 5.4: HTTP cache
   reloaded <http://share.ez.no/blogs/core-development-team/new-in-ez-5.4-http-cache-reloaded>`__

SiteAccess aware "dynamic settings injection"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For those that have already started to create services in Symfony with
eZ Publish Platform and encountered having to read SiteAccess settings,
you have up until this point had to depend on a service called
ConfigResolver which would allow you to lookup settings depending on the
currently SiteAccess. However as of 5.4 this is no longer necessary,
with a new syntax your able to specify the settings you want in normal
service configuration and get the resulting scalar value directly in
your service.

-  Blog post: `New in eZ 5.4: Dynamic settings
   injection <http://share.ez.no/blogs/core-development-team/new-in-ez-5.4-dynamic-settings-injection>`__

Improved Search API Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

eZ Publish Platform 5.4 and 5.3.3 included noticeable (significant when
using several languages) performance improvements when using the
Platform Search API.

-  Blog
   post: \ `http://share.ez.no/blogs/core-development-team/new-in-5.3.3-and-5.4-improved-api-performance <http://share.ez.no/blogs/core-development-team/new-in-5.3.3-and-5.4-improved-api-performance>`__
