About Field Types
-----------------

| They are the most granular building block for content managed by eZ
Publish. The system comes with about `30 native
types <FieldTypes-reference_10158198.html>`__ that cover most common
needs (Text line, Rich text, Email, Author list, Content relation, Map
location, Float...)
| FieldTypes are responsible for:

-  storing data, either using the native storage engine mechanisms, or
   specific means

-  validating input data

-  making the data searchable (if applicable)

-  displaying an instance of the type

Custom FieldTypes are a very powerful type of extension, since they
allow you to hook deep into the content model.

You can find the in-depth \ `documentation about FieldTypes and their
best practices <Field-Type-API-and-best-practices_2719880.html>`__. It
describes how each component of a FieldType interacts with the various
layers of the system, and how to implement those.

About this tutorial
-------------------

 

This tutorial aims at covering the conception and development of a
custom eZ Publish 5 FieldType.

We will do this by implementing a Tweet Field Type. It will:

-  accept as input the URL of a tweet
   (`https://twitter.com/ <https://twitter.com/>`__\ <username>/status/<id>)

-  fetch the tweet using the twitter oEmbed API
   (`https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-tweets <https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-tweets>`__)

-  store the tweet’s embed contents and url

-  display the tweet's embeded version when displaying the field from a
   template

Getting the code

The code created throughout this tutorial is available on
github: \ `https://github.com/ezsystems/TweetFieldTypeBundle <https://github.com/ezsystems/TweetFieldTypeBundle>`__.

Steps
-----

The bundle
~~~~~~~~~~

| FieldTypes, like any other eZ Publish 5 extensions, must be provided
as Symfony 2 bundles. This chapter will cover the creation and
organization of this bundle
| Read more about \ `Creating the
bundle <Creating-the-bundle_19890712.html>`__ and `structuring the
bundle <Structuring-the-bundle_19890837.html>`__.

API
~~~

| This part will cover the implementation of the eZ Publish API elements
required to implement a custom FieldType
| Read more about `implementing the
API </pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=EZP&title=API+implementation&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=19890704>`__.

Converter
~~~~~~~~~

| Storing data from any FieldType into the Legacy Storage Engine
requires that your custom data is mapped to the data model.
| Read more about `Implementing the Legacy Storage Engine
Converter <Implementing-the-Legacy-Storage-Engine-Converter_19890943.html>`__.

Templating
~~~~~~~~~~

| Displaying a FieldType's data is done through a twig template.
| Read more about `implementing the FieldType
template <Template-implementation_19890950.html>`__.
